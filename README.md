# Hospital-Revenue-and-Patient-Payment-Analysis-Dashboard

Description:
This project aims to create a comprehensive Excel dashboard that provides insights into hospital revenue generation and patient payment status. The dashboard will help hospital administrators and financial analysts understand key metrics related to patient demographics, departmental performance, doctor productivity, admission and discharge trends, financial health, and diagnosis insights. By leveraging Power Query Editor and Excel's data visualization tools, the project will deliver a user-friendly interface that displays critical information, enabling data-driven decision-making for improving hospital operations and financial management.

Project Objectives:
Calculate Total Revenue Generated by the Hospital:
Summarize total revenue from patient bills to provide an overview of the hospital's financial performance.
Analyze Payment Status Distribution:
Categorize and visualize the payment statuses (Paid, Unpaid, Pending) to understand cash flow and outstanding dues.
Evaluate Patient Demographics:
Assess the age and gender distribution of patients to identify demographic trends.
Departmental Performance Analysis:
Analyze patient admissions, average total bills, and department-specific revenue to determine departmental efficiency and profitability.
Doctor Productivity Insights:
Evaluate the number of patients treated by each doctor and the total revenue generated under their care.
Admission and Discharge Trends:
Identify monthly patient admission patterns and average length of hospital stays to optimize resource allocation.
Diagnosis and Financial Analysis:
Examine common diagnoses and associated costs to prioritize medical services and budget allocations.
